At the moment, there are only these screens.

## About this Project

The idea of the Website is:

_"Share knowledge in the form of Website, providing a simple way to learn"._

PS: Site foi apenas o contexto escolhido por mim para este projeto, por enquanto esta em um estagio inicial, Mas vou vincular a um CMS  que esta sendo iniciado tambem.

## Why?

This project is part of my personal portfolio, so, I'll be happy if you could provide me any feedback about the project, code, structure or anything that you can report that could make me a better developer!

For now this project is in an initial phase, but over time I will improve this project to go deeper into the studies.

## Some Observations about this App

1 - There is no Login/Registration functionality, the buttons and forms on the Login Screen are for UI issues only.

2 - The website is not responsive at the moment due to the time that has to be dedicated and at the moment the functionalities themselves are being prioritized
